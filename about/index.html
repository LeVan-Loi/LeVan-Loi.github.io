**About Lê Văn Lợi**

After retiring in 2020, I developed a strong interest in _machine learning_, _bioinformatics_, _cryptocurrency_, _space exploration_, _quantum computing_, and _DNA_. As a result, I have devoted much of my time to staying up-to-date with emerging technologies in these fields. My goal is to leverage this knowledge to create digital tools that can assist both individuals and businesses in remaining competitive in a rapidly changing marketplace.
