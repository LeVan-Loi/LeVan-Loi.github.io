<h1>About Lê Văn Lợi</h1>

<p>After retiring in 2020, I developed a strong interest in <i>machine
learning</i>, <i>bioinformatics</i>, <i>cryptocurrency</i>, <i>space
exploration</i>, <i>quantum computing</i>, and <i>DNA</i>. As a result, I have
devoted much of my time to staying up-to-date with emerging technologies in
these fields. My goal is to leverage this knowledge to create digital tools
that can assist both individuals and businesses in remaining competitive in a
rapidly changing marketplace.</p>
